# Electric_vehicle_Range_prediction
In the face of increasing energy and environmental problems, the development of new energy vehicles has become a new trend in the automobile industry, and the electric vehicle (EV) is the main force of new energy vehicles. New technologies also come with new problems to deal with, one such problem with Electric vehicles (EV) has always been the range of travel and route to the nearby Charging stations. A better overview of the driving range and vehicleâ€™s energy consumption may help in reducing the overall range anxiety of many EV drivers. This work proposes a novel Machine learning (ML) based predictive strategy to estimate the driving range of electric vehicles and route them to the nearby charging stations. The range predictor takes into account the specific vehicle parameters over a distributed network of charging stations. The charging station are modelled as entities with many charging points and, in each stage of the prediction the status of availability of charging points is monitored and updated to a cloud database. The most feasible route from the arrival point to the destination is finally obtained by using effective path finding algorithms like A* algorithm. The path thus obtained offers minimal travel distance while charging the vehicle at necessary charging stations present in the route.
